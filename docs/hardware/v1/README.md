the NFC board and LED strips.

The upper portion is held together with $${\color{red}\text{four T8 screws}}$$,
at the outer perimeter of the enclosure. The
$${\color{blue}\text{inner four Philips \\#0 screws}}$$ hold the fan used to cool
the Pi, and should not be removed unless to service the fan.

The lower portion is held together with $${\color{orange}\text{four T10 screws}}$$.
Try not to open the lower portion as there is a diffuser sheet that you have to
accurately place on the acrylic panel. If it shifts, you can see through the
acrylic panel and the lights will not diffuse properly.
